# Calories_Burnt_Prediction
<br>
Objective: Predict calories burnt based on exercise and personal data using machine learning.
<br>
- Developed a machine learning model using XGBoost regression to predict calories burnt.
<br>
- Used datasets from Kaggle, merging and preprocessing calories and exercise data for model training.
<br>
-Converted categorical variables (e.g., gender) into numeric format for analysis.
<br>
-Explored data distributions and checked for missing values.
<br>
- Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.48 and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 4.71 with an R-squared accuracy of 0.998.
<br>
- Split data into 80% training and 20% testing sets for effective model validation.
<br>
- Employed seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization to analyze dataset distributions and correlations with plotting of heatmaps to understand data patterns and relationships.
